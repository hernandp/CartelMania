# CartelMania for Windows

![Main Display](https://github.com/hernandp/CartelMania/blob/master/README.res/main.png)

## Overview

The aim of this project is to reach version 1.0 with a similar feature set
of the popular 80's era program "BannerMania" which was available for PC
and Macintosh systems.  It's intended to be a remake for Windows systems,
with a more or less modern approach.

"Cartel" is an approximate Argentinian-Spanish translation of "Banner".

CartelMania code is based on:

* Modern C++
* Windows Template Library 9.1
* PugiXML
* GDI+ subsystem

## Compatibility

With the current code and compiler/linker settings, CartelMania can be run from
Windows XP up to Windows 10 systems.

(Probably WINE can be used to run it under Linux: this is *untested*).

## Requirements for building

Visual Studio 2015/17 should be enough. Ports to other compilers plus migration to
CMake based project should be reasonable for the future.

## Features

Some of the intended features are already implemented, some will be (partially,
or completely)...  some will not. 

## Current feature set

This is the current (as July 2017) feature set. 

See 'Issues' section for lacking and/or problematic areas.
